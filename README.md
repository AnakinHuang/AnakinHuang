## 🚀 About Me

I’m a computer scientist and researcher interested in how modern ML and foundation models can be used to understand complex systems — from disease-associated brain cell states to end-to-end AI music generation. I enjoy building things that actually run: reproducible pipelines, research code that other people can use, and small systems that behave like “real” tools rather than class demos.

Right now, my work spans single-cell foundation models (scGPT, Geneformer), distributed systems, and multimodal generative AI.

## 🧪 Current Research

**Research Assistant, University of Rochester Medical Center**  
*Training Generative AI to Identify Disease-Associated Cell States* (May 2025 – Present)  

- Build end-to-end pipelines for brain snRNA-seq datasets from psychiatric and neurodegenerative cohorts (QC, normalization, HVG selection, batch correction, metadata harmonization).  
- Apply scGPT-based reference mapping and cell-type annotation; generate latent embeddings with Scanpy / PyTorch on NAIRR GPU clusters (Slurm).  
- Fine-tune single-cell foundation models (scGPT, Geneformer) for cell-type/state classification and disease trajectories; run ablations and baselines and visualize results with UMAPs and model cards.
